row by row. We propose a new test for testing the hypothesis H

and investigate its theoretical and numerical properties. The limiting null distribution of the test statistic is derived and the power of the test is studied. The test is shown to enjoy certain optimality and to be especially powerful against sparse alternatives. The simulation results show that the test significantly outperforms the existing methods both in terms of size and power. Analysis of a prostate cancer dataset is carried out to demonstrate the application of the testing procedures. When the null hypothesis of equal covariance matrices is rejected, it is often of significant interest to further investigate how they differ from each other. Motivated by applications in genomics, we also consider recovering the support of
and testing the equality of the two covariance matrices row by row. New procedures are introduced and their properties are studied. Applications to gene selection are also discussed. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

abstract = {This paper presents a discussion of the collinearity problem in regression and discriminant analysis. The paper describes reasons why the collinearity is a problem for the prediction ability and classification ability of the classical methods. The discussion is based on established formulae for prediction errors. Special emphasis is put on differences and similarities between regression and classification. Some typical ways of handling the collinearity problems based on PCA will be described. The theoretical discussion will be accompanied by empirical illustrations.
